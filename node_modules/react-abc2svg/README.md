A React component that uses the awesome [abc2svg](https://github.com/moinejf/abc2svg) to display music notation written using the [ABC notation](http://abcnotation.com).

### Usage

```js
<Abc2Svg
  abcNotation={'X:1\nT:Example\nM:4/4\nC:Trad.\nK:G\n|:Gccc dedB|dedB dedB|c2ec B2dB|c2A2 A2BA|'}
  showErrors
/>
```

## References

* To make things clear, this is just a fancy cover to make you things easier in case you're working with [React](https://reactjs.org). All the hard work related to convert the abc notation to svg was already made by [Jef Moine](https://github.com/moinejf) and his awesome library [abc2svg](https://github.com/moinejf/abc2svg). Don't forget to check it out!

## IMPORTANT:

If you are using the component multiple times in the same page, to avoid strange behaviours each component needs to have a unique `%%fullsvg` value. If you don't provide one in the abc notation, the component will generate a random one for you.
